== Bitcoin and Lightning payments in Crowdfunding Plugin ==

The Bitcoin Crowdfunding plugin allows you to launch Bitcoin crowdfunding campaigns on your site fast and simply.

With the Coinsnap Bitcoin Lightning payment processing plugin you can immediately accept Bitcoin Lightning payments for your crowdfunding campaigns. You don't need your own Lightning node or any other technical requirements if you'd like to provide payments via Coinsnap payment gateway.

Simply register on [Coinsnap](https://app.coinsnap.io/register), enter your own Lightning address and install the Coinsnap payment module in your WordPress backend. Add your store ID and your API key which you'll find in your Coinsnap account, and your supporters can fund your campaigns with Bitcoin Lightning right away!

If you want to use another BTCPay server as Payment provider, you need to know your store ID, your API key and gateway URL as required parameters.
